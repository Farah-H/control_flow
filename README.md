# Control Flow Notes 
'Cotrol flow' is the process of creating a 'flowchart' for your program, telling it what to do when and if certain events occur. It is the basis of automation. 

## `if`, `elif` and `else` 
In python `if` statements can be used to tell the program what to do when a certain condition happens. The syntax is as follows:
```python
if condition: 
    do_this
```

`elif` can be used to extend an `if` statement by adding more conditions, however the last condition must be an `else`if there is an `elif` clause. The syntax is as follows:

```python
if condition_1:
    do_something_1
elif condition_2:
    do_something_2
elif condition_3:
    do_something_3
else:
    do_something_4
```
## for loops 

## while loops
